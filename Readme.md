## Project Title
**Resume Review Rewards**

## Project Description
The "Resume Review Rewards" smart contract is a decentralized platform that allows individuals to submit resumes for review and reward others for reviewing them. By leveraging an ERC-20 token system, the contract incentivizes users to participate in the resume review process. Reviewers are rewarded with tokens each time they provide feedback on a resume. The system tracks how many reviews each reviewer has completed, and they can claim their accumulated rewards. 

This platform ensures transparency, fairness, and efficiency by using blockchain technology, making the process of giving and receiving resume feedback rewarding and secure.

## Future Enhancements
1. **Reputation System**: Introduce a reputation or rating system for reviewers, where high-quality feedback can be recognized with additional rewards or benefits.
2. **Automatic Resume Review Matching**: Implement a matching algorithm that pairs reviewers with resumes based on their expertise or experience.
3. **Token Staking**: Allow reviewers to stake tokens for priority review tasks or to access higher rewards based on their stake.
4. **Decentralized Autonomous Organization (DAO) Integration**: Create a DAO where the community can vote on the future direction of the platform and reward structures.
5. **User Interface (UI)**: Develop a user-friendly frontend for interacting with the contract, making it accessible to non-technical users who wish to submit resumes or review others' resumes.
